![Guess the Place logo](assets/logo/guesstheplace.png)

**Guess the Place** is a small game realized with Flutter, Inspired by GeoGuessr. You can try to guess the geographical location of a random place in the world, by recognizing elements like road signs, fauna and flora. There are two different game modes.

 - **Log in and play**: This game mode is reserved for registered users. Don't worry, you can quickly create an account inside the app, only a nickname and a password are required. You will then play a game composed by 5 matches. The closer you will get to the actual position of the place in every, the bigger will be your score at the end of the game. You will be able to see your highscore in a leaderboard, where you will be able to beat the other players.
 
 - **Arcade mode**: In this game mode, you won't need to create an account. You'll have to provide just a nickname to save your guesses. You will able to play as many matches as you want, without a time limit, however you won't be able to see your high score in the leaderboard. Your guesses will still be shown in a match history, along with the guesses of the other registered and unregistered players. However, there won't be a ranking for unregistered players. 


## How to play


In every match you will see a randomly picked place in the world. The difficulty of the match may vary: in some cases you will see a spherical image, and you might also be able to move to another picture and explore the place from another point of view, while sometimes you will be able to see just a two-dimensional picture. The kinds of places that you will see will also vary: from rural mountain roads without asphalt to highways, from urban centers to remote countryside areas, ans sometimes even pictures taken from a plane, from a boat or inside a building.

You will then have to search for clues in what you are seeing: vehicle models, license plates, road signage, vegetation, animals, sand colour... Don't worry, you can spend as much time as you want. When you feel ready to guess a place, you can mark it in the map and submit your guess. You will immediately see your score and the actual location of the place you explored.
